# Barcode Scanner

This repository contains the Barcode Scanner app, developed as part of Sean Allen's SwiftUI Fundamentals Course. It's a project showcasing the integration of SwiftUI, UIKit, and AVFoundation for barcode scanning functionality.

## Overview

The Barcode Scanner app utilizes various iOS frameworks:

- **SwiftUI**: Provides the app's user interface and structure.
- **UIKit**: Used in conjunction with SwiftUI for certain components and functionalities.
- **AVFoundation**: Empowers the app to scan barcodes efficiently.

## Accomplishments

Developing the Barcode Scanner was a significant achievement for me. While the journey included challenges in understanding AVFoundation, it ultimately provided a solid foundation in combining UIKit with SwiftUI. This project allowed me to delve deeper into iOS development and broaden my skill set.

## Key Features

- Barcode scanning functionality
- SwiftUI and UIKit integration
- Utilization of AVFoundation for camera input and barcode recognition

## Getting Started

To run the Barcode Scanner app locally:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Build and run the project on a simulator or a physical device.

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to Sean Allen for his SwiftUI Fundamentals Course, which provided the inspiration and guidance for this project.
